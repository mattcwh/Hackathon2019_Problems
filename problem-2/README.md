# Calculating Protein Mass

## Problem 

In a weighted alphabet, every symbol is assigned a positive real number called a weight. A string formed from a weighted alphabet is called a weighted string, and its weight is equal to the sum of the weights of its symbols.

The standard weight assigned to each member of the 20-symbol amino acid alphabet is the monoisotopic mass of the corresponding amino acid.

__Given__: A protein string P of length at most 1000 aa.

__Return__: The total weight of P. [Consult the monoisotopic mass table](https://github.com/KHSDTC/Hackathon2019_Problems/blob/master/problem-2/monoisotopic-mass-table).

### Sample Dataset

`SKADYEK`

### Sample Output

`821.392`
