# Hackathon2019 

## Coding problems

During the event we will be solving a set of problems with a particular focus on computational biology. The following exercises will cover algorithmic design and automated data analysis tasks. 

- Problems 1-4 will test your algorithmic thinking for which coding solutions can be easily tested. 
- Problem 5 will test you collaborative effort skills.  

[**1. Counting DNA Nucleotides**](./problem-1/README.md)

Count the number nucleotides from a given DNA sequence.

[**2. Calculating Protein Mass**](./problem-2/README.md)

Calculate protein mass from a given protein sequence.

[**3. Finding a Motif in DNA**](./problem-3/README.md)

Find a specific motif within a DNA sequence.

[**4. Rabbits and Recurrence Relations**](./problem-4/README.md)

How many rabbits there are?

[**5. Automated submission of analyses to online servers**](./problem-5/README.md)

Construct a Python script that automatically submits fasta files to the [SignalP 4.1 Server](http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/). Create a web clawer and navigate through websites.
